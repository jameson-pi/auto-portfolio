# Instructions to Change All Fields of `info.json`

To update the fields in the `info.json` file, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the `info.json` File**:
    - Navigate to the directory where `info.json` is stored.

    - Use a text editor of your choice (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text, Notepad++) to open the `info.json` file.

3. **Edit the Fields**:

            "title": "Your Title",
            "location": "City, State",

                "email": "your.email@example.com",
                "phone": "123-456-7890",
                "website": "https://yourwebsite.com",
                "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",
                "github": "https://github.com/yourusername"
            }
        }
      ```

4. **Save the Changes**:
    - After making the necessary changes, save the file.

5. **Validate the JSON**:
    - Ensure that the JSON syntax is correct. You can run the file and see if it makes any errors

6. **Close the File**:
    - Once validated and saved, close the text editor.

By following these steps, you can successfully update all the fields in the `info.json` file.
